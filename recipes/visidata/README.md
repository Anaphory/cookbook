# What is visidata?

[visidata](https://visidata.org/) is a terminal-based spreadsheet
software for analysing, discovering, and arranging all kinds of structured
data.

For additional information please also consult the project's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata) as well as the very
helpful and informative [documentation](http://visidata.org/docs/).

# visidata and CLDF

The plain-text and structured nature of CLDF data lends itself nicely to
spreadsheet-based analysis tools (as has already been shown elsewhere in
this repository). The recipes in this folder illustrate this by using visidata
to explore different CLDF data sets.

## Recipes

* a screencast (TODO) outlining a typical workflow with visidata and CLDF data
* a step-by-step guide (TODO) for JOINing CLDF data with visidata
* custom commands and helpers (TODO) to make CLDF data analysis with
  visidata easier
