# Working with CLDF data in R

These scripts illustrate how to use basic R (i.e. without any external dependencies, packages, etc.) to work with CLDF data sets. `merge()` and the `df[filter$condition %in% filter2$condition,]` construct are used to combine the different data sources and perform basic queries and filtering tasks.
